# Progress: ConsultEase System

## 1. Current Status
The ConsultEase project has completed several initial development phases for the Central System, including core feature implementation (student authentication, faculty dashboard, consultation requests, admin panel with CRUD operations) and RFID hardware integration. The ESP32 Faculty Desk Unit development is still in its early stages (initial file structure created).

The immediate next steps involve a significant UI overhaul for the Central System to achieve a modern and user-friendly experience, followed by the full implementation of the ESP32 Faculty Desk Unit firmware, comprehensive end-to-end testing, and creation of deployment/user documentation.

## 2. What Works (Central System - Core Functionality)
*   **Database Setup:** PostgreSQL schema (`students`, `faculty`, `consultations`) is defined and created by `DatabaseService`. Initial data seeding for a sample faculty member.
*   **Student Interaction (Main UI - `main_dashboard_screen.py`):**
    *   Student authentication via simulated RFID (`AuthenticationScreen`).
    *   Display of faculty availability on `MainDashboardScreen`.
    *   Submission of consultation requests.
*   **Admin Dashboard (`admin_dashboard_screen.py`):**
    *   CRUD operations for Students (including RFID tag capture for new students).
    *   CRUD operations for Faculty.
    *   Viewing all consultation requests.
    *   Logout functionality.
*   **Backend Services (`database_service.py`, `rfid_service.py`, `mqtt_service.py`):**
    *   `DatabaseService`: Handles all database interactions for students, faculty, and consultations.
    *   `RFIDService`: Implemented for both simulation and actual hardware (`pyserial` for USB reader VID:ffff, PID:0035). Includes single tag capture mode for admin.
    *   `MQTTService`: Basic setup for connecting to a broker, subscribing to faculty status (simulated), and publishing consultation requests.
*   **Basic Project Structure:** Separate directories for `central_system` and `faculty_desk_unit`.
*   **Error Resolution:** Recent work successfully resolved database schema update issues and a `RuntimeError` concerning `QTableWidget` deletion in the admin dashboard's consultation tab.

## 3. What's Left to Build / Refine
*   **UI Overhaul (Central System - Major Task):**
    *   Redesign all PyQt5 screens (`AuthenticationScreen`, `MainDashboardScreen`, `AdminDashboardScreen`) for a modern, intuitive, and user-friendly experience.
    *   Improve visual appeal, layout, and user workflows.
*   **ESP32 Faculty Desk Unit (Major Task - Largely Unimplemented):**
    *   **`display_module.cpp/.h`**: Implement logic to render faculty status, incoming consultation requests, and system messages on the 2.4" TFT display.
    *   **`ble_module.cpp/.h`**: Implement BLE scanning for faculty personal beacons (using placeholder IDs initially) to automatically update presence. Logic for RSSI filtering/thresholding if necessary.
    *   **`mqtt_module.cpp/.h`**: Implement robust MQTT message handling to receive consultation requests from the Central System and publish faculty status updates.
    *   **`main.cpp` (ESP32):** Integrate all modules, manage device state, handle Wi-Fi/MQTT connections.
    *   Configuration (`config.h`): Finalize and allow easy update of WiFi, MQTT broker, and faculty BLE beacon identifiers.
*   **End-to-End System Integration & Testing:**
    *   Thorough testing of the Central System with (simulated and then actual) ESP32 Faculty Desk Units.
    *   Verification of MQTT message flows for status updates and consultation requests.
    *   Testing of RFID student identification with consultation workflow.
    *   Admin panel functionality fully tested with integrated system.
*   **MQTT Broker Robustness:** Ensure Mosquitto setup on RPi is stable and configured correctly for production use (e.g., persistence).
*   **Deployment & User Documentation (Major Task):**
    *   Step-by-step deployment guide for setting up the Raspberry Pi (OS, Python, PyQt5, PostgreSQL, Mosquitto, project code) and ESP32 units.
    *   Troubleshooting manual for common issues.
    *   User manual for Students (how to use the Central System).
    *   User manual for Faculty (how to interpret Desk Unit display, understand BLE beacon).
    *   User manual for Administrators (how to use Admin Dashboard, manage users/system).
*   **Refinements & Potential Additions (Lower Priority unless specified otherwise):**
    *   Notifications system (details to be clarified if this is part of "modern UI").
    *   Advanced admin reports.
    *   Full implementation of backward-compatible MQTT topics if still deemed necessary.
    *   Security enhancements beyond basic setup (e.g., SSL for MQTT, more robust DB access control if required for deployment).

## 4. Known Issues
*   The ESP32 firmware is currently a skeleton and needs full implementation.
*   The current PyQt5 UI is functional but not yet "user-friendly and modern" as per the new requirement.

## 5. Timeline & Milestones
*   To be defined in the detailed project plan (next step). The plan will be phased, focusing on UI Overhaul, ESP32 Development, Integration/Testing, and Documentation.
